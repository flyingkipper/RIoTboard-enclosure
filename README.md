RIoTboard-enclosure
===================

OpenSCAD enclosure for RIoTboard SBC

The design consists of a solid block with rounded corners / edges.
This is then hollowed out and internal structures added such as screw posts.
A mock-up of the RIoTboard is then used to make the openings for the various connectors.
The final result is then cut into pieces for printing.  

Two options, a two part enclosure and a three part one.

I have printed this in PLA on a RepRapPro Mendel with 0.5mm nozzle 0.2mm layer height.
